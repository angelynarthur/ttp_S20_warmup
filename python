#words together in the following list
still_words = ['1','22','333','4444','55555']


[len(i) for i in still_words]

# 2 - get the numeric values of the list items (eg. the value of '22' is 22), and print the sum.


still_words = [int(i) for i in still_words]
print(still_words)
sum(still_words)


# 3 - How do you fix the typo in this list, without rewriting the whole list?
words = ['one','two','three','for','five']

words = [word.replace ('for','four') for word in words]
